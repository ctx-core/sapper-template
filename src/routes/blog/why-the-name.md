In war, the soldiers who build bridges, repair roads, 
	clear minefields and conduct demolitions — all under combat conditions — are known as *sappers*.

For web developers, the stakes are generally lower than those for combat engineers.
	But we face our own hostile environment:
		underpowered devices, poor network connections,
		and the complexity inherent in front-end engineering.
	Sapper, which is short for **S**velte **app** mak**er**, is your courageous and dutiful ally.
